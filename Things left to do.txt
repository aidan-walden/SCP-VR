THE PLAN:
Release the game on steam with early access with only light containment present
Make all SCP's toggle-able from the main menu (To avoid annoyance from 106 being unstoppable without his containment chamber, etc)




NEW TODO (only things that make light containment work are listed):
Brackets signify that a VR headset must be used to test the feature properly
[Fix mask detection]
Figure out how to make 106 ignore locked doors and things of that nature
Add electric outages so 173 can move
[Add Proper Movement]
[Test to see if 1123 works properly]
Add 939 (Depends upon proper movement, mostly)
Finish up "stupid" rooms like dead end halls, storage room, waiting room, etc. (For item spawns have an item spawner script that waits until nav is done generating then just instaniates the object)
Add ambient sounds
Add "garbage" items and less critical items like MasterCard, night vision goggles, electric parts, etc. (night vision goggles may not be necessary w/o scp-966)
Add 173 vents
Figure out map randomizing
File for listing of game on Steam
Make SCP community aware of game
Polish up the game, fix rough areas
Playtest
Release! (hopefully)
Update and bugfix the game until heavy and ez are in
Find and create VR-specific SCPs (May want to make community poll on whether development should deviate from original game or not)
